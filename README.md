####School Assignment: Four in a Row - Sprint 3
###EPIC for this Sprint
Develop an AI player for the Four-in-a-Row game, building on the functionality from previous sprints. Implement and test the AI logic with multiple difficulty levels.

###User Stories
1. As a user, I want to ensure that the user stories from sprint 1 and sprint 2 have been completed, so that I know the program logic and graphical interface are thoroughly tested.

2. As a user, I want to be able to play against two types of AI:
      - A basic AI that allows me to feel confident about winning the game.
      - A challenging AI that tests my skills and provides a tough opponent.
3. As a system owner, I want comprehensive testing of the two AI types, including automated testing and performance comparisons against other available AI to assess their difficulty levels.

4. New requirement: When selecting players, each player should be configurable as either a ‘human,’ a ‘basic AI’ (dumb bot), or a ‘smart AI’ (smart bot). This means that combinations such as a bot versus bot, human versus bot, or basic AI versus smart AI should all be possible.

##EPICS in Previous Sprints:
**[Sprint 1](https://github.com/YevShch/Fyra-i-rad-/tree/dev-SPRINT1):** Develop the core game logic (for two human players) without a graphical interface, ensuring it follows test-driven development (TDD) principles with object-oriented JavaScript and Vitest/Jest for testing.

**[Sprint 2](https://github.com/YevShch/Fyra-i-rad-/tree/dev-GUI-Sprint-2):** Build a graphical user interface (GUI) for the game and ensure it is thoroughly tested.


## Upcoming Sprint:
**Sprint 4:** Implement network functionality to allow players to compete over the internet, and test this feature.
